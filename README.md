# San-Francisco-Trees-Analysis
Overview : 
This project focuses on analyzing data related to trees in San Francisco. The objective is to explore and understand the distribution, species diversity, and other characteristics of trees across the city. The project employs ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to process the data, beginning with data preparation and profiling using Alteryx, followed by data cleaning and storage in a new database.

Dataset : 
The dataset used in this project contains information about trees in San Francisco. It includes details such as tree species, location, height, diameter, and other relevant attributes. Analyzing this dataset can provide valuable insights into the urban forest landscape of San Francisco.

Process : 
Data Preparation and Profiling with Alteryx: The initial step involved preparing the data for analysis and profiling it using Alteryx. This stage helped in understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying any inconsistencies, and gaining insights into the data distribution.

Data Cleaning: After data profiling, the next phase focused on cleaning the dataset. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting errors, and ensuring data consistency to prepare it for further analysis.

Database Storage: Once the data was cleaned and prepared, it was stored in a new database for efficient retrieval and analysis. This ensured that the data is organized and accessible for future use and analysis.
